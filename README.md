# examples-shopify

Different code samples for interacting with Flow for Shopify customers.

## order-summary

This directory contains an example of how to convert a shopify order into a Flow Order Summary.

## Usage

Add JSON file in the order-summary/samples directory and in the command line run `node run.js` in the order-summary directory. The JSON file will then be parsed and converted into a Flow Order Summary, with the output going into the output folder.

## Tapcart Integration

Tapcart builds native mobile apps for brands which have existing Shopify stores. This integration guide is intended to help connect that Tapcart app with Flow and provide Flow localized experiences in those native mobile apps.
